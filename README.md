# php_checkers
Simple Docker image containing basic php quality checkers. For now it includes:
- [php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPhp/PHP-CS-Fixer)
- [phpmd](https://phpmd.org/)

# Usage
The main usage of this image is for using it along with PhpStorm. For more information look [here](https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2018/12/code-quality-tools-support-enhancements/). Defining the PHP Interpreter to the container will do the job.
